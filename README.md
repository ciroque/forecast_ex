## Getting Started

### Installation

Add `forecast_ex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:forecast_ex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Algorithm Implementations

### Rolling Average

This method calculates the average of data points over a specified number of periods, 'rolling' forward. It's a way to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends or cycles.
